Host-Microbiome Interactions in Carollia perspicillata

Description

This repository contains research articles on host-microbiome interactions in the telencephalon and liver of the frugivorous bat Carollia perspicillata. Using metatranscriptomic approaches, these studies investigate the diversity and transcriptional activity of microbial communities within these tissues, as well as the hostâ€™s interactive responses. The findings provide insights into tissue-specific microbiome dynamics and their potential implications for immune regulation and zoonotic spillover.

	â€¢	Summary: This study integrates host transcriptome and meta-transcriptome analyses to characterize microbial gene expression and host responses across two distinct tissues. The results highlight tissue-specific microbial communities, metabolic pathways, and immune regulation mechanisms that contribute to batsâ€™ unique disease tolerance and potential zoonotic risk.
